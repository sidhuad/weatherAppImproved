# Weather-app-Project-1
project 1 user submitted weather display app 

* As a user, I want to see a user submitted based web application displaying accurate weather using the submitted photos and images.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the web application pulls real time data for cities across the world

* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Use a CSS framework (see suggestions).
